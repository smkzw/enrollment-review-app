# Conference Context: phase5-slice61af-independent-clinical-code-review-20260828

Created: 2026-08-28 20:11:56
Objective: 只读独立复核 Phase 5.8d 病毒学 p803-p805 条件性豁免与同源候选定向修订。本轮不是视觉测试。请从三个角度挑战：1）代码是否真正防止把“无需再次检查”误判为必须执行的筛选操作、是否完整识别要求证明“未重复执行”的过度证据；2）同一来源单元拆出多个候选后，按上一轮 wire 位置定向修订是否会导致范围外改写、错位、候选丢失或错误放行；3）真实 v6 工件的三个控制点是否忠实于 body.p804/p805，并避免重复流程第14项和 EX-22。必须读取当前源代码、相关合成测试、v5失败工件与v6接受工件及父级验收摘要；发现问题须给出文件/字段/可复现路径。只读，不修改文件，不把测试通过当作临床接受。
Task type: `complex_delivery_conference`
Risk: `high`
Conference mode: `parallel`

## Codex Main Venue

- Chair: Codex.
- Duties: understand the real task, decompose, define sources of truth, route work, protect boundaries, verify final artifacts, own visual/browser/PPT/PDF checks, own production writes, and deliver to the user.

## Conference Panel Assignment

- Visual/design/HTML/PPT tasks use a Codex-led panel with no sub-venue chair. The effective visual participant chain is ``; it is filtered against the actual execution route nodes recorded below before dispatch.
- Chinese labels or Chinese sentence review is handled directly by Codex and does not start a conference.
- Other complex, logic-heavy, evidence-sensitive, artifact-heavy, code-review, and high-risk contradiction work uses a Codex-chaired panel with no sub-venue chair. Participant 1 is Pi/google-antigravity `gemini-3.7-flash` (high) -> Pi/OpenCode Go `muse-spark-1.2-contributor` (high) -> Kimi Code `k3-256k` (medium) -> Codex subAgent `gpt-5.6-luna` (max). Participant 2 is Grok Build `grok-4.6` (medium) -> Pi/Cursor `cursor-grok-4.6` (medium) -> Pi/cms-router `minimax-m3` (high). Codex remains the final authority.
- Every conference role starts with one bounded same-session pass. Codex reviews its quality and may dispatch zero or more targeted follow-up prompts through the same session. A new session is a routing failure unless a primary role failed before a resumable session existed and the documented fallback was activated.

## Execution-Conference Model Deduplication

- Linked execution task: `phase5-slice61ab-candidate-repartition-contract-20260828`
- Execution evidence status: `linked`
- Excluded provider/model nodes: `cursor-cli/auto`
- If an execution packet exists but runner evidence is missing or unreadable, initialization fails closed. Agent adapters are ignored for this check; provider boundaries and model identity are retained, and effort differences do not bypass deduplication.

## Source Of Truth

- TODO: Add authoritative local files, extracts, datasets, screenshots, URLs, or user-provided materials.
- Do not add production paths unless the user explicitly authorized reading them for this task.

## Scope

- In scope: TODO
- Out of scope: TODO

## Success Criteria

- Each selected primary route returns an auditable output or an explicit health/fallback reason.
- The prompt uses the correct Agent identity, provider/model, effort, tools-enabled policy, and same-session continuation policy.
- The runner records session, usage/tool observations, fallback decisions, and failure reasons without `--max-turns 1`.
- No production path is read or modified; Codex retains final acceptance.

## Parallel Work Rule

For logic-heavy, rigor-sensitive, or artifact-heavy tasks, each participant independently runs the whole bounded workflow and writes a separate output. Leads compare after all available participant outputs are in or explicitly marked pending.

## Timeout Policy

- Participant soft wait: 60 minutes.
- Large-task participant wait: 120 minutes.
- Chair hard wait: 120 minutes.
- Failure rule: Do not fail a model for slow response alone; fail only on terminal error, provider exhaustion/rate limit after controlled retry, empty/truncated retry output, or no useful progress after the high-budget same-session recovery loop. A catalog/auth/transport health preflight timeout or malformed response is diagnostic and must still allow one live route attempt; explicit user routes also proceed when the catalog is stale or incomplete, while a genuinely missing CLI or native transport boundary may block. If a resumable session exists after a step/size boundary, continue it before fallback; repeated identical output/tool evidence triggers the no-progress breaker.
- Pass/turn boundary: one conference prompt is one conference pass. The
  `--max-turns` value controls internal Agent tool-calling turns and is never
  set to 1 for substantive conference execution; generated participant and
  chair commands use the route budgets recorded by the guard.

## Risk Boundaries

- External Agents are advisory; Codex remains final authority.
- Codex owns visual/browser/PPT/PDF/rendered checks, live authority checks, final clinical/regulatory conclusions, and production writes.
- Do not mark a slow model failed solely due to latency.

## Loop Log

- 2026-08-28 20:11:56: Conference initialized by `hermes_workflow_guard.py init-conference`.
